# Data Science Portfolio 
A collection of statistical and machine learning projects I've worked on for academic, self-learning, and professional purposes. 

## Python [![python][3]][4]
### [Predicting the likelihood of a rocket launch success](https://github.com/kellibelcher/IBM-Data-Science-Capstone)
- Used a REST API and web scraping tools to collect data related to SpaceX launches.
- Explored the data using different visual analytics tools, including interactive maps, graphs, and a [Plotly dashboard](http://spacexdashappkellibelcher.pythonanywhere.com/).
- Built a Support Vector Machine model to predict the likelihood of a rocket launch success with an [Area Under the Curve of 0.958](https://www.kaggle.com/kellibelcher/spacex-rocket-landing-predictive-analysis).

### [Customer Attrition Mitigation and Retention Analysis](https://rpubs.com/kellibelcher/769293)
- Tested several supervised learning algorithms to develop a classification model that predicts customer churn with 81.4% sensitivity. 
- Analyzed all relevant customer data and identified customer retention strategies for a telecom company.
### [Finding Donors for Charity](https://rpubs.com/kellibelcher/795493)
- Developed a K-Nearest Neighbors model to predict whether an individual will make a donation to a national nonprofit veterans' organization with an Area Under the Curve of 0.763.
### [Predicting Customer Purchases](https://rpubs.com/kellibelcher/735222)
- Compared Support Vector Machines and Logistic Regression to identify which customers to target in a new direct marketing campaign with 71.6% sensitivity. 
### [Dow Jones Stock Performance Predictions](https://rpubs.com/kellibelcher/795841)
- Predicted the returns of each stock in the Dow Jones Index using Support Vector Regression.
- Quantified the risk associated with each investment using a Capital Asset Pricing Model. 
### [Bank Marketing Case Study](https://rpubs.com/kellibelcher/726187)
- Built a logistic regression model to predict whether or not a customer would subscribe to a long-term bank deposit with 73.4% accuracy. 
- Model selection and validation were performed using Akaike and Bayesian Information Criterion.
### [Time Series Analysis](https://rpubs.com/kellibelcher/767453)
- Utilized ACF and PACF plots to develop a seasonal ARIMA model and compared it to an Exponential Smoothing model.
- Forecasted the monthly US unemployment rate and quantified the models' performance using the Root Mean Squared Error.
