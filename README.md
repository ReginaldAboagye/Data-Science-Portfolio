# Data Science Portfolio 
A collection of statistical & machine learning projects I've worked on for academic, self-learning, and professional purposes.

### [Customer Retention Case Study](https://rpubs.com/kellibelcher/769293)
- Tested several different supervised learning algorithms to build a model that predicts customer churn with 81.4% sensitivity. 
- Analyzed all relevant customer data and developed a focused customer retention program.
### [Finding Donors for Charity](https://rpubs.com/kellibelcher/795493)
- Developed a K-Nearest Neighbors model to predict whether an individual will make a donation to a national nonprofit veterans' organization with an Area Under the Curve of 76.3%.
### [Predicting Customer Purchases](https://rpubs.com/kellibelcher/735222)
- Compared Support Vector Machines and Logistic Regression to develop a predictive model that can identify which customers to target in a new direct marketing campaign with 71.6% sensitivity. 
### [Stock Price Predictions](https://rpubs.com/kellibelcher/795841)
- Predicted the returns of each stock in the Dow Jones Index using Support Vector Regression.
- Quantified the risk associated with each investment using a Capital Asset Pricing Model. 
### [Bank Marketing Case Study](https://rpubs.com/kellibelcher/726187)
- A logistic regression model was used to predict whether or not a customer would subscribe to a long-term bank deposit with 73.4% accuracy. 
- Model selection and validation were performed using Akaike and Bayesian Information Criterion.
### [Time Series Analysis](https://rpubs.com/kellibelcher/767453)
- Compared seasonal and non-seasonal ARIMA models to Exponential Smoothing to predict monthly US unemployment rates.
