# Data Science Portfolio

A collection of data science projects I've worked on for academic, self-learning, and professional purposes.

## Statistical & Machine Learning Projects

- [Customer Retention Case Study](https://rpubs.com/kellibelcher/769293): Tested several different supervised learning algorithms to build a model that accurately predicts customer behavior to help mitigate attrition. Analyzed all relevant customer data and developed a focused customer retention program.
- [Finding Donors for Charity](https://rpubs.com/kellibelcher/795493): Developed a KNN model to predict whether an individual will make a donation to a nonprofit veterans' organization with an Area Under the Curve of 0.763.
- [Predicting Customer Purchases](https://rpubs.com/kellibelcher/735222): Compared Support Vector Machines and Logistic Regression to develop a predictive model that can identify which customers to target in a new direct marketing campaign with 71.6% sensitivity. 
- [Bank Marketing Case Study](https://rpubs.com/kellibelcher/726187): A logistic regression model was used to predict whether or not a customer would subscribe to a long-term bank deposit that achieved 73.4% accuracy. Model selection and validation were performed using the Akaike and Bayesian Information Criterion.
- [Time Series Analysis](https://rpubs.com/kellibelcher/767453): Compared ARIMA and seasonal ARIMA models to Exponential Smoothing to predict monthly US unemployment rates.
