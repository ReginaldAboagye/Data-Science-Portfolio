# Data Science Portfolio

A collection of data science projects I've worked on for academic, self-learning, and professional purposes.

## Machine Learning Projects

- [Customer Retention Case Study](https://rpubs.com/kellibelcher/769293): Testing out several different supervised learning algorithms to build a model that accurately predicts whether a member will churn  using several different supervised learning methods, including Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machines, and Random Forests
- [Predicting Customer Purchases](https://rpubs.com/kellibelcher/735222): Tested several different supervised learning algorithms to build a model that can accurately identify which customers to target in a new direct marketing campaign with 71.6% sensitivity. 
- [Bank Marketing Case Study](https://rpubs.com/kellibelcher/726187): A logistic regression model was used to predict whether or not a customer would subscribe to a long-term bank deposit that achieved 73.4% accuracy. Model selection and validation was performed using the Akaike and Bayesian Information Criterion.
